# NBC-model
For the sake of challenge, this project was implemented purely without using any external libraries or even built-in libraries such as 'csv' and 'math'. Only the 'matplotlib' library was imported for the purpose of plotting graphs.

So there is no dependency except 'matplot'. Just run the code!
(But, you need 'train.csv', 'test.csv', 'stopwords.txt' files.)
